What is it?

It's on the game "Who wants to be a Millionare?", but it's text based.
You will get 10 questions in a random order, and you have to choose the correct answer out of 4.

How it works / instrucitons:

You have to type for every question: A / B / C / D
If you choose option: "STOP" , you will stop playing, and get the money you earned.
You will have 2 help panels that you can use, but only once each.
  - You can Google for the info that you are looking for.
  - The crowd will help you with the right answer.
 
If you choose an incorrect answer you will instantly lose the game.
The money that you bring home depends on your performance.
  - You earn money after the 3rd correct question.
  - You earn money after the 6th correct question.
 
 And you win the game of course, if you've guessed all the answers correct.
 
 Please enjoy!
 Best wishes from the Gooses!
